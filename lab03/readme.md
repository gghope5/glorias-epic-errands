## Gloria's Epic Errands

### Introduction
Gloria's Epic Errands is a custom webmap using Leaflet that shows the user my weekly errands and the route I typically take to do them. The errands include groceries at Food Lion, pet supplies at Tractor Supply Co., a trip to my local landfill, a coffee break at a local roaster, and then finally a walk at my favorite park. It's essentially an idealized weekend routine for me.
